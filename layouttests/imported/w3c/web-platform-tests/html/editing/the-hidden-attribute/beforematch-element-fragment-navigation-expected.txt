FAIL Verifies that fragment navigation reveals hidden=until-found elements. assert_false: expected false got true
FAIL Verifies that fragment navigation reveals all parent hidden=until-found elements. assert_false: parentid should not have the hidden attribute. expected false got true
FAIL Verifies that the beforematch event is fired synchronously and bubbles after fragment navigation. assert_true: beforematch should have been fired on parentid. expected true got false
FAIL Verifies that when a beforematch event handler moves a matching element, we scroll to its final location. assert_true: The beforematch event should have been fired. expected true got false
FAIL Verifies that the beforematch event is fired on the right element when there are multiple hidden=until-found elements. assert_true: bar was navigated to, so it should get the beforematch event. expected true got false
FAIL Verifies that no scrolling occurs when an element selected by the fragment identifier is detached by the beforematch event handler. assert_true: beforematch should be called when window.location.hash is set to #detach. expected true got false
FAIL No scrolling should occur when the beforematch event handler sets the target element's style to display: none. assert_true: beforematch should be called when window.location.hash is set to #displaynone. expected true got false
FAIL Scrolling should still occur when beforematch sets visiblity:hidden on the target element. assert_true: beforematch should be called when window.location.hash is set to #visibilityhidden. expected true got false
PASS Verifies that the beforematch event is not fired on elements without hidden=until-found.
