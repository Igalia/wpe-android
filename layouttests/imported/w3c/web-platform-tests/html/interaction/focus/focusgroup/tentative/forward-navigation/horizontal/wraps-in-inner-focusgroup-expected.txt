FAIL When the focus is set on the last item of an inner focusgroup that supports wrapping while its parent focusgroup doesn't (in the axis of the arrow key pressed), the focus should move to the first item of the inner focusgroup. assert_equals: expected Element node <span id="item3" tabindex="-1">item3</span> but got Element node <span id="item4" tabindex="-1">item4</span>
