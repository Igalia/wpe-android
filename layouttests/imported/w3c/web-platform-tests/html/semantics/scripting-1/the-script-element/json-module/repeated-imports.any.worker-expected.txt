PASS Importing a specifier that previously failed due to an incorrect type assertion can succeed if the correct assertion is later given
FAIL Importing a specifier that previously succeeded with the correct type assertion should fail if the incorrect assertion is later given assert_unreached: Should have rejected: Dynamic import should fail with the type assertion missing even if the same specifier previously succeeded Reached unreachable code
FAIL Two modules of different type with the same specifier can load if the server changes its responses assert_equals: expected (string) "hello" but got (object) object "[object Object]"
FAIL An import should always fail if the same specifier/type assertion pair failed previously assert_unreached: Should have rejected: import should always fail if the same specifier/type assertion pair failed previously Reached unreachable code
PASS If an import previously succeeded for a given specifier/type assertion pair, future uses of that pair should yield the same result
