Infinite intrinsic table widths

Originally, algorithm for computing intrinsic table inline size had a special case:
If table is fixed, and has a width:%, its intrinsic inline size was "infinite".
This ensured that fixed table with 100% width inside block layout would expand to container's width.

Different containers do not have reasonable handling of intrinsic infinitely sized children. For those, table's intrinsic size should never be infinite, but instead default to regular max size.

PASS table's width inside flexbox width:auto is not infinite
PASS table's width inside flexbox width:max-content is infinite
PASS table's width inside flexbox width:min-content is infinite, but the flexbox is finite; scenario 1
PASS table's width inside flexbox width:min-content is infinite, but the flexbox is finite; scenario 2
PASS table's width inside grid width:auto is not infinite
PASS table's width inside grid width:max-content is infinite
PASS table's width inside a table cell is infinite
PASS table's width inside an absolute block is infinite
