Caption-side

Checks that browsers implement properly the caption-side property

This should read ABC:
The first caption (C) should be put on the bottom because it inherits caption-side:bottom from the table;
The second captin (A) should be put on the top because it has caption-side:top specified;

<table style="caption-side:bottom"><caption>C</caption><tbody><tr><td>B</td></tr></tbody><caption style="caption-side:top">A</caption></table>
C
B
A

PASS Caption-side inherits and reorder captions properly
PASS Multiple captions can be rendered
