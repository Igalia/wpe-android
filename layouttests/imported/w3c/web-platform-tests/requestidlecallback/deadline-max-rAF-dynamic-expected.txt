Test of requestIdleCallback deadline behavior

The test can pass accidentally as idle deadlines have a maximum but they can always be shorter. It runs multiple times to expose potential failures.


FAIL Check that the deadline is changed if there is a new requestAnimationFrame from within requestIdleCallback. assert_less_than_equal: expected a number less than or equal to 16.666666666666668 but got 101
